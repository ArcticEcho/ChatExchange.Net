# It's been fun, but...

Due to the ever-changing nature of Stack Exchange's authentication process (or at least, that's how it feels), I've decided to retire this project.

When I first wrote this library, I had originally anticipated it to be used by only several internal projects. The goal was to simply write a fully functioning chat library as fast as possible; therefore, code quality/design weren't atop of my TODO list. This inevitably lead to the state in which the library is in today.

# But wait, there's more!

A [new library](https://github.com/SOBotics/StackExchange) is on the way! The objective for this new project is simple, make it the library that ChatExchange.Net *should've* been (with added support for the Stack Exchange API). **When the library reaches beta I'll be officially archiving this repository and taking the nuget package offline.**
